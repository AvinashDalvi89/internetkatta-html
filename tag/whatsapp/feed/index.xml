								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People all around the world use WhatsApp to connect with small businesses they care about — from online clothing companies in India to auto parts stores in Brazil. But WhatsApp was built for people and we want to improve the business experience. For example, by making it easier for businesses to respond to customers, separating customer and personal messages, and creating an official presence.</p>
<p>Here’s how:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Profiles:</strong> Help customers with useful information such as a business description, email or store addresses, and website.</li>
<li><strong>Messaging Tools:</strong> Save time with smart messaging tools — <strong>quick replies</strong> that provide fast answers to frequently asked questions, <strong>greeting messages</strong> that introduce customers to your business, and <strong>away messages</strong> that let them know you’re busy.</li>
<li><strong>Messaging Statistics:</strong> Review simple metrics like the number of messages read to see what’s working.</li>
<li><strong>WhatsApp Web:</strong> Send and receive messages with WhatsApp Business on your desktop.</li>
<li><strong>Account Type:</strong> People will know that they’re talking to a business because you will be listed as a Business Account. Over time, some businesses will have Confirmed Accounts once it’s been confirmed that the account phone number matches the business phone number.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Messages</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some feature yet to come:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone number changed to new number</li>
<li>Change business name which you already verified if brand name changed.</li>
<li>WhatsApp payments integration with UPI</li>
<li>iOS version yet to released.</li>
</ul>
